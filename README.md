### iris-decision-trees-c-5.0

Classifying the IRIS flowers using the Decision Tree C5.0. I also tried the CART Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) just to check the algorithm, though it is falsely tested in a classification problem.

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
